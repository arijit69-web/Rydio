# Rydio

## Project Description

**Rydio** is a backend application designed for **ride booking**, **driver allocation**, and **real-time tracking**. Built on an **MVC-based monolithic architecture**, it ensures streamlined management and scalability. It leverages **WebSockets** for real-time communication between drivers and passengers, providing instant updates and seamless ride coordination. Driver locations are stored in **Redis** using **geohashing**, allowing fast and efficient proximity-based searches while significantly reducing database load. The booking system is engineered to **prevent double bookings**, ensuring consistent and reliable ride assignments. Together, these features enable Rydio to deliver a high-performance and seamless experience for both users and drivers.
